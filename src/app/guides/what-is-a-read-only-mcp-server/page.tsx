      <h1>What is a read-only MCP server?</h1>
      <p className="guide__lead">A read-only MCP server gives an AI application tools for retrieving information. Those tools cannot create, edit, or delete records. OpenLookup is a read-only example backed by public data. You install it with <code>npx -y openlookup</code>. An MCP client can then call eleven lookup tools.</p>

      <h2>What does MCP let a server expose?</h2>
      <p>The official MCP specification says that tools let language models interact with external systems, including querying databases, calling APIs, and performing computations. Each tool has a name, description, and input schema. A client discovers them with <code>tools/list</code> and invokes one with <code>tools/call</code>. <a href={specUrl}>Read the MCP tools specification</a>.</p>

      <h2>What makes an MCP tool read-only?</h2>
      <p>A read-only tool has a retrieval boundary: it accepts lookup inputs and returns a result, but it does not expose write, delete, or mutation operations. That boundary reduces the action surface, but it is not a complete security guarantee. The MCP specification says clients should treat tool annotations as untrusted unless they come from a trusted server and should show inputs before sensitive calls.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Inspect the tool name, description, and input schema.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the requested operation is a lookup, not a mutation.</li>
        <li>Check the returned receipt, date, and coverage limits before relying on the answer.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>OpenLookup answer format</h2>
      <p>OpenLookup exposes eleven read-only lookup tools. The tools cover stale facts, directories, and compliance. The package returns text in <code>content</code> for compatibility. It returns structured data in <code>structuredContent</code> for clients that support it. The landing page lists each tool, its arguments, its public data boundary, and whether it requires credentials.</p>

      <h2>How do I try a read-only MCP server?</h2>
      <p>You run <code>npx -y openlookup</code> from an MCP client that supports local servers. You start with one narrow lookup. You inspect the returned source and checked time. A clear or passing result provides scoped evidence. It is not a universal compliance conclusion. The tool output is current for the source it checked. It does not promise coverage of every related record.</p>
